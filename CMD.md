catch a response storing it in file object using curl
```py
curl -D headers.txt -o body.txt -X POST -F username=user1 -F password=password1 http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
```
Yes, you can use a variable to capture the response headers directly in your shell script without writing them to a file. Here’s how you can do it using command substitution and environment variables.

### Capturing the Response Headers in a Variable

You can use `curl` with the `-i` option to include headers in the output and then pipe the result to `awk` to extract the session cookie. Here’s how:

```sh
# Make the login request and capture the response headers and body in a variable
response=$(curl -i -X POST -F "username=user1" -F "password=password1" http://127.0.0.1:5000/login)

# Extract the session ID from the response headers
session_id=$(echo "$response" | grep 'Set-Cookie' | sed -n 's/.*session_id=\([^;]*\).*/\1/p')
echo "Session ID: $session_id"

# Use the session cookie to access the /dashboard endpoint
curl --cookie "session_id=$session_id" http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard
```

### Explanation

1. **Make the Login Request and Capture Response:**
   ```sh
   response=$(curl -i -X POST -F "username=user1" -F "password=password1" http://127.0.0.1:5000/login)
   ```
   - `-i`: Includes the HTTP response headers in the output.
   - The entire response (headers and body) is stored in the `response` variable.

2. **Extract the Session Cookie:**
   ```sh
   session_id=$(echo "$response" | grep 'Set-Cookie' | sed -n 's/.*session_id=\([^;]*\).*/\1/p')
   ```
   - `echo "$response"`: Outputs the stored response.
   - `grep 'Set-Cookie'`: Finds the `Set-Cookie` header.
   - `sed -n 's/.*session_id=\([^;]*\).*/\1/p'`: Extracts the session ID using a regular expression.

3. **Access Protected Endpoint:**
   ```sh
   curl --cookie "session_id=$session_id" http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard
   ```
   - `--cookie "session_id=$session_id"`: Sends the session cookie with the request.

### Complete Script

Here is the complete script that captures the response headers in a variable and uses it to navigate to the `/dashboard` endpoint:

```sh
# Log in and capture the response headers and body in a variable
response=$(curl -i -X POST -F "username=user1" -F "password=password1" http://127.0.0.1:5000/login)

# Extract the session ID from the response headers
session_id=$(echo "$response" | grep 'Set-Cookie' | sed -n 's/.*session_id=\([^;]*\).*/\1/p')
echo "Session ID: $session_id"

# Use the session cookie to access the /dashboard endpoint
curl --cookie "session_id=$session_id" http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard
```

### Summary

Using a variable to capture the response headers makes the script cleaner and avoids the need to create temporary files. The `response` variable stores the full response, and you can extract the session ID using standard text processing tools like `grep` and `sed`. Then, you can use this session ID to authenticate further requests to your Flask application.
